Test music player for internal and external storage audio files

I have created this for testing the methods for fetching audio files from both internal and external storgae.
I still have lots of bugs in the code. Some of them are:
i. When I click a song from the list it doesn't play the respective song but it plays the next song of current song.
ii. Play/Pause button doesn't change as it has to.

Feel free to make changes and please recommend and notify the changes you made for bugs.
Thank you.
